##API RESTful with Laravel

This is the project created by the course API RESTful con Laravel: Gu√≠a Definitiva
available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/api-restful-con-laravel-php-homestead-passport).

This course in my opinion provides a mid level in Laravel, includes OAuth2 by Laravel Passport.

The structure of this API is a simple selling system, includes models like:

- User
- Seller
- Buyer
- Products
- Categories
- Transactions
